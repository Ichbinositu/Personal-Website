        I am a software Enginnering student at Moringa school,cohort FT08.
        I joined the institution after graduating from the Technical University of kenya with a degree in Civil Engineering.
        My motivation and intention to partake in this course stems from a strong conviction that software development should be among my skills since barely a day goes by without interacting with web applications and sites.
        Besides that, computer related studies are universally applicable, thus their marketability.
